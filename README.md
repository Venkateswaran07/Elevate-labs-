# Web Development Internship Task 5: Contact Form with HTML Validation

This project contains the solution for Task 5, which involves adding a fully validated contact form to the multi-page website.

## Features

- **Contact Form**: Integrated into `contact.html` with fields for Name, Email, Phone, and Message.
- **HTML5 Validation**:
  - `required` attributes on all fields.
  - `type="email"` for email validation.
  - `pattern="[0-9]{10}"` for strict 10-digit phone number validation.
  - `maxlength` constraints on Name (30) and Message (200).
- **Responsive Styling**: Form elements are styled with Flexbox and standard box-model properties to look good on all devices.
- **Accessibility**: All inputs have associated `<label>` tags.
